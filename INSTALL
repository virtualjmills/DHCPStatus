This file outlines the process for installing DHCPStatus.  If you run into 
problems, or have any questions, feel free to email me at 
mjtg@users.sourceforge.net, and I'll do my best to help.


Installing DHCPStatus.
======================
Logically, DHCPStatus consists of two major components:
   - a library of modules that read the dhcpd.conf and dhcpd.leases files and
     correlate the information in them, and
   - one or more user-interface scripts.  When the user runs one of these, it
     calls the appropriate library modules to generate the information, then
     the script formats the output in a manner that suits the way the script
     has been called.

DHCPStatus is designed this way to separate the data correlation code from the 
user interface code.

At the moment, there are two user interface scripts - a CGI script and a 
command-line script.  I hope to add other interfaces/displays as time goes by 
(Perl/Tk, curses, XML, ...), just for variety.

To install DHCPStatus, you'll first need to install the library of modules, 
then install the script(s) for the user interface(s) that you wish to use to 
call DHCPStatus.


Running Locally.
================

Extract contents of DHCPStatus "runlocal" branch.

Install required Perl library:
   sudo -- apt install libperl4-corelibs-perl;

cd scripts/;

./dhcpstatus;


Installing the library of modules.
==================================
For the purposes of this exercise, we're going to install them in 
/usr/local/dhcpstatus.  However, you can install the libraries in any 
directory you wish - simply modify the instructions below accordingly.

1. Un-zip and un-tar the DHCPStatus distribution file somewhere (you may have 
already done this):
   % gzip -dc dhcpstatus_x.xx.tar.gz | tar -xvf -

This will create a distribution directory called dhcpstatus_x.xx, where the x's
are version numbers.

2. Create your library directory:
   % mkdir /usr/local/dhcpstatus

3. cd into the library directory:
   % cd /usr/local/dhcpstatus

4. Un-tar the library tar-file in the distribution directory:
   % tar -xvf /path/to/dhcpstatus_x.xx/libraries.tar

This will create a sub-directory called dhcpstatus in the directory that 
you're in.  It will also create a file called dhcpstatus.ini.

So, there should now be a directory:
   /usr/local/dhcpstatus

with library modules:
   /usr/local/dhcpstatus/dhcpstatus/*.pm

and a .ini file:
   /usr/local/dhcpstatus/dhcpstatus.ini

5. Edit the dhcpstatus.ini file.  It contains some parameters that affect the 
behaviour of DHCPStatus.  Perhaps the most important of these parameters is 
the location of your dhcpd.conf and dhcpd.leases files.


Installing the user interface scripts.
======================================
As mentioned above, there are currently two user interfaces to DHCPStatus - 
CGI and command line.  You can install either one or both of these, its up to 
you (obviously you need to install at least one of them, or else you're 
wasting your time here ...).

In the un-tar'd distribution directory (/path/to/dhcpstatus_x.xx) , there's
a scripts sub-directory that contains two files:
   - dhcpstatus.cgi: a CGI script that generates HTML
   - dhcpstatus: a command-line script that generates text.

If you want to use the CGI script interface to access DHCPStatus through your 
web browser, then simply copy it to your web server's cgi-bin directory, eg.
   % cp /path/to/dhcpstatus_x.xx/scripts/dhcpstatus.cgi /path/to/cgi-bin

Similarly, if you want to use the command-line version of dhcpstatus, then 
copy that script to a directory somewhere in your path, eg:
   % cp /path/to/dhcpstatus_x.xx/scripts/dhcpstatus /usr/local/bin

For each script that you've copied, you'll need to edit that file to make sure 
the following are correct for your machine:
   - the first line in the script points to the location of your Perl binary,
   - the directory pointed to by the "use lib" statement (a few lines into the
     script) is the directory containing your libraries and .ini file.

For example:

   #!/usr/bin/perl -w
   # ...

   use lib "/usr/local/dhcpstatus";


Running DHCPStatus.
===================
Once you have installed DHCPStatus, running it is fairly straight-forward.  
For the CGI interface, simply point your web browser at 
http://your.dhcpd.server/cgi-bin/dhcpstatus.cgi (or whatever the correct URL 
is).  The command-line version can be run simply by typing
   % dhcpstatus

at the command prompt.  This will print out a summary of your DHCPD 
environment.  For a more detailed report on a particular subnet, type:
   % dhcpstatus -s <subnet-id>

eg.
   % dhcpstatus -s 123.45.67.0


Enjoy !!!
